## Headwind Extension for VSCode

Headwind is an opinionated Tailwind CSS class sorter for Visual Studio Code. It enforces consistent ordering of classes by parsing your code and reprinting class tags to follow a given order.

Headwind runs on save, will remove duplicate classes and can even sort entire workspaces.
